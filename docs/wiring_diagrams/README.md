## üéØ What You'll Accomplish

**Phase 1 Goal**: Establish I2C communication between ML-303's PIC microcontroller and Arduino Pro Micro

**Success Criteria**:
- Arduino powers on when ML-303 is powered
- Serial monitor shows "Waiting for commands from PIC..."
- ML-303 operates exactly as before (no interference)
- Foundation ready for future expansions (LCD control, effects, MIDI)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Reminders

- **ML-303 has NO reverse polarity protection** - double-check wire colors
- **Always power off** before making connections
- **Test with multimeter** before applying power
